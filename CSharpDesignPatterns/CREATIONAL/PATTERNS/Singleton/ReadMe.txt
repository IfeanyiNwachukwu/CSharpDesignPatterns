The intent of the Singleton pattern is to ensure that a class onl has
one instance and to provide a global point of access to it.


A Singleton defines an instance operation that lets clients access kits unique instance.


USE CASES

1. When there must be exactly one instance of a class, and it must be 
accessible to clients from a well-known access point

2. When the sole instance should be extensible by subclassing and clients should be able to use an extended instance without modifying their code.
