TBuilder
The intent of the builder pattern is to separate the construction of a
complex object from its representation. By doing so, the same
construction process can create different representations.


Use Cases for the Builder Pattern
1.When you want to make the algorithm for creating a complex
object independent of the parts that make up the object and how
they're assembled

2.When you want to construction process to allow different
representations for the object that's constructed
