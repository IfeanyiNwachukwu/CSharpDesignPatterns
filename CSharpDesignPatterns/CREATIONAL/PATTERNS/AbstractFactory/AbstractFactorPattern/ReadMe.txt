Abstract Factory
The intent of the abstract factory pattern is to provide an interface for
creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying
their concrete classes


Use Cases for the Abstract Factory Pattern
1.When a system should be independent of how its products are
created, composed and represented

2.When you want to provide a class library of products and you only
want to reveal their interfaces, not their implementations

3.When a system should be configured with one of multiple families
of products

4.When a family of related product objects is designed to be used
together and you want to enforce this constraint
