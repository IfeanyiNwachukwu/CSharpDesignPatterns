The intent of the factory method pattern is to define an interface for creating an object but to let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.


Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

USE CASES

1. When a class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create.

2. When a class wants its subclasses to specify the object it creates.

3. As a way to enable reusing of existing objects
