Facade
The intent of this pattern is to provide a unified interface to a set of
interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes
the subsystem easier to use.

Use Cases for the Composition Pattern
1.When you want to provide a simple interface into a complex
subsystem

2.When there are many dependencies between a client and the
implementation classes of the abstraction
