Composite
The intent of this pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies. As such, it lets clients treat individual
objects and compositions of objects uniformly: as if they all were
individual objects.


Use Cases for the Composition Pattern
When you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects
When you want to be able to ignore the difference between
compositions of objects and individual objects
